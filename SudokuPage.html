    <h1>Sudoku SAT Solver</h1>

    <p class="project-description">
      Puzzluoku is an advanced SAT-based solver for Sudoku puzzles, combining algorithmic logic with a user-friendly interface.
      It is designed to handle complex puzzles efficiently while providing an engaging, minimalist experience for users.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction & Background</h2>
    <p class="project-description">
      In the evolving field of digital solutions for logic-based entertainment, the intersection of user-friendly software and sophisticated
      computational algorithms presents a significant opportunity for innovation. My dissertation introduces "Puzzluoku," an application designed
      to transform the experience of solving Sudoku puzzles through a SAT solver. This software is not merely a utility for automating puzzle
      solving but a comprehensive platform aimed at enhancing user interaction with one of the most popular puzzles globally. The initiative
      behind Puzzluoku is rooted in a dual objective: to simplify the resolution of puzzles through advanced algorithmic support and to enrich the
      user experience by offering an intuitive and interactive interface.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem Statement and Project Motivation</h2>
    <p class="project-description">
      Sudoku puzzles challenge solvers to fill a grid with digits under strict constraints. Traditional methods, either manual or generic solvers,
      do not cater to nuanced variations of Sudoku that enthusiasts often encounter. Puzzluoku addresses these gaps by providing a tailored,
      efficient, and engaging solution that appeals to a broad spectrum of Sudoku enthusiasts, from novices to seasoned experts.
    </p>

    <h2>Programming Choice</h2>
    <p class="project-description">
      The code for the "Puzzluoku" Sudoku solver project is written in C#. This choice provides a robust and versatile environment with
      strong support for object-oriented programming, a rich set of libraries for data structures and logical operations, and excellent
      debugging tools within Visual Studio. It also integrates well with the .NET framework for creating intuitive user interfaces.
    </p>

    <h2>Background: Sudoku and Computational Complexity</h2>
    <p class="project-description">
      Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle that has captured interest for its mathematical structure and computational complexity.
      Sudoku is NP-complete, meaning there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve every puzzle, and solving general Sudoku can be
      reduced to the 3-SAT problem. This makes the problem theoretically and practically challenging.
    </p>

    <h2>Algorithmic Approaches to Solving Sudoku</h2>
    <p class="project-description">
      Given its NP-completeness, various strategies exist: backtracking, brute-force, constraint propagation, and SAT solver adaptations.
      Puzzluoku transforms Sudoku into a SAT problem using polynomial 3-SAT reduction, where each cell is a Boolean variable and each clause
      represents constraints, enabling SAT solvers to efficiently tackle even challenging puzzles.
    </p>

    <h2>Relevant Research</h2>
    <p class="project-description">
      The project draws from multiple studies including:
    </p>
    <ul class="project-description">
      <li>Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) applied to NP-complete problems</li>
      <li>Backtracking, simulated annealing, and alternating projection methods</li>
      <li>Polynomial 3-SAT reduction and SAT encodings for Sudoku</li>
      <li>Heuristic solutions and advanced SAT solving techniques for difficult puzzles</li>
      <li>Tools like SUDOKUSAT for classifying puzzle difficulty</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sudoku as a SAT Problem</h2>
    <p class="project-description">
      Sudoku puzzles can be represented as SAT problems by encoding each cell as a Boolean variable and each constraint as clauses in a
      Boolean formula. Minimal and extended encodings optimize solver efficiency, with complex puzzles benefiting from additional clauses
      that improve performance. This approach allows advanced SAT techniques—like clause learning and heuristic-based variable selection—to
      solve difficult puzzles efficiently.
